  contents:
  - I am a linguistic anthropologist specializing in linguistic diversity. Grounded in the intersection of language and culture, I research social interaction as mediated by and simultaneously producing experiences, identifications, and ideologies. My work is foremost concerned with the daily co-creation of meaning in different educational settings in the Netherlands on a wider scale and the German-Dutch border area on a more local scale.
