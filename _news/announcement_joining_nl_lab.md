I am thrilled to have joined NL Lab (KNAW Humanities Cluster) as a guest researcher starting in December 2022. I am looking forward to the interdisciplinary exchange! My main activities at [NL Lab](https://nl-lab.net/) in the upcoming year will be research dissemination and the development of a grant proposal with the preliminary title ‘Emotions in the Dutch as Second Language Classroom: Newcomers’ affective engagements during Language Learning‘.
