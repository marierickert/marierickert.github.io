I am a Linguistic Anthropologist specializing in Linguistic Diversity. Currently, I am a final year PhD candidate at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Maastricht University and the Institute of Dutch Philology, University of Münster. My research approaches social interaction as mediated by and simultaneously producing experiences, identifications and ideologies, grounded in the intersection of language and culture. I am interested in the ways in which multilingualism takes shape in sociocultural contexts, with a specific emphasis on regional and other minority languages, language practices in educational settings, and the role of language in shaping processes of identification.

My current project focuses on children’s and teachers’ participation in language practices in in linguistically diverse Early Childcare and Education on both sides of the German-Dutch border. The project is conducted in the scope of LIMES, funded by the European Commission’s Marie-Curie COFUND programme. It examines how language policies, language ideologies and language hierarchies mutually shape each other as well as toddlers’ linguistic socialization, against the background of the region’s linguistic diversity. I explore this this by means of ethnography; combining long-term fieldwork in Early Childhood Education and Care, participant observation and interviews with audio and video recordings, drawing on linguistic anthropology and multimodal conversation analysis.

I hold a M.Sc. Social and Cultural Anthropology from the University of Amsterdam and a B.A. in Cultural Studies with a minor in Educational Sciences from the University of Bremen.
